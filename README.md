This is the code of the *RoPeRT* team for the **HashCode 2016**.
The problem statement is in the [delivery file](delivery.pdf).

You just have to execute the [run.sh](run.sh) script to compile and execute the code for the input files of the contest.
It will generate the corresponding output files in the **output** folder.



Enjoy
