This is the code of the *RoPeRT* team for the **HashCode 2016**.
The problem statement is in the **delivery** file.

You just have to execute the **run.sh** to compile and execute the code for the input files of the contest.
It will generate the corresponding output files in the **output** folder.



Enjoy
